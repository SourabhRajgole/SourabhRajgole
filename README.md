## Hi there 👋

# I’m Sourabh Rajgole

Cybersecurity M.S. candidate at George Washington University (May 2026) with internship experience translating security inputs (logs, tool outputs, and process gaps) into clear findings, remediation notes, and stakeholder-ready documentation. I’m targeting entry-level SOC / Security Analyst / GRC-adjacent roles where I can contribute to detection, triage, and audit-ready operations.  
Location: Arlington, VA

## Expertise

I work best at the intersection of security operations and documentation. I’m comfortable starting with “messy” inputs (log exports, scan results, SOP gaps), extracting the signal, and delivering actionable outcomes: risk narratives, escalation notes, and repeatable playbooks.

Recent hands-on focus areas include:
- Log analysis and alert triage (Splunk-style workflows)
- Vulnerability validation and remediation verification (OpenVAS/Greenbone, Nmap, SSL/TLS checks)
- Network security fundamentals and traffic analysis (CORE labs, iptables, SSH hardening, Wireshark/tcpdump)
- Controls intent and evidence organization (NIST CSF / ISO 27001-aligned thinking)
